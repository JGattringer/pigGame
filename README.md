## Description

The "Dice Game" is a web-based game where two players take turns rolling a virtual die. The game's objective is to accumulate points by rolling the die and deciding when to "hold" your score to avoid losing it. The player who reaches a predetermined score (default: 100) first wins the game.

## Features

- Two players can play the game.
- Simulated dice rolling functionality.
- Score tracking for each player.
- Winning condition (reaching a certain score, default: 100).
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Game Rules

- Each player can roll the die as many times as they like on their turn.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it's the other player's turn.
- Players can choose to "hold" their current score, adding it to their total score.
- The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds the winning score (default: 100).
